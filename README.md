# Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Low-Light Conditions
 
Anomaly detection in surveillance videos involves analyzing the video data to identify patterns of behaviour that are considered normal or expected, and then using this data to identify any deviations from these patterns. 

This method has a number of advantages over conventional surveillance techniques that rely solely on human operators. It has the ability to analyze video data in real-time, allowing for the detection of potential hazards in real-time and it can also analyze large amounts of video data more efficiently than humans, thereby reducing the likelihood of missing key events due to operator fatigue or distractions.

Tech Stacks/Technologies used: OpenCV for object detection and tracking, YOLOv5 to detect and classify objects in each frame of the surveillance/live video, Deep Neural Networks to identify anomalies.

This project stands out since it is capable of carrying out numerous tasks at once, such as using computer vision to detect fire, identify faces, and identify weapons. Along with visual representations of the detected objects in the video stream, it also provides audible feedback for the detection of weapons. Thus, it has the potential to significantly enhance safety and security and is a valuable addition to any system requiring enhanced threat detection capabilities.
